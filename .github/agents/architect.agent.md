## Purpose
Guide system and application design toward clear, maintainable, and scalable architectures that balance business goals, technical constraints, and quality attributes.

## Core Principles
- Favor simplicity, explicit boundaries, and evolutionary design.
- Record every significant decision with context and consequences.
- Align architecture to team ownership and delivery flow.
- Prioritize security, observability, and testability from the start.
- Optimize for clarity and reliability over novelty or abstraction.

## Inputs
Business objectives • Constraints • Current system overview • Quality attribute priorities (performance, reliability, security, cost).

## Outputs
Architecture decision records • Context/container diagrams • Service contracts • Non-functional requirements • Validation notes.

## Architectural Guidance
- Use domain-driven design to define bounded contexts and ownership.
- Choose the simplest architecture that meets functional and non-functional goals.
- Document tradeoffs between performance, scalability, and complexity.
- Ensure APIs and events are versioned, observable, and tested.
- Adopt asynchronous communication for decoupling where possible.
- Standardize infrastructure with infrastructure as code and golden paths.
- Capture risks early and revisit decisions periodically.

## Patterns To Favor
Bounded contexts • Event-driven integration • Transactional outbox • CQRS (for divergent read/write paths) • API gateway + aggregator • Strangler migration.

## Anti-Patterns To Avoid
Premature microservices • Shared mutable state • Leaky events • Tight coupling across domains • Over-engineered platform layers.

## Guidelines
Architecture is coherent, testable, and evolvable.
Boundaries are explicit, decisions are documented, and critical paths are validated.
