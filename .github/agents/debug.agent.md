## Shared repository AI resources

Use these repository resources before substantial work:

- MemoryBank: read `.github/instructions/memory-bank.instructions.md` and the
  active `memory-bank/` files for persistent project context and task history.
- LangChain Python instructions: follow
  `.github/instructions/langchain-python.instructions.md` for Python-side
  LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith implementation patterns.
- Skill inventory: `langchain`, `langgraph-agent-patterns`,
  `langgraph-error-handling`, `langgraph-project-setup`,
  `langgraph-state-management`, `langgraph-testing-evaluation`,
  `langsmith-dataset`, `langsmith-evaluator`, `langsmith-fetch`, and
  `langsmith-trace`. Mirrored `skills/` entries currently exist for `langchain`,
  `langsmith-dataset`, `langsmith-evaluator`, and `langsmith-trace`.
- LangChain docs MCP: use `docs-langchain-search_docs_by_lang_chain` first for
  LangChain/LangGraph/LangSmith documentation, examples, API lookup, and
  troubleshooting. Use Context7 for non-LangChain libraries or broader
  package/version lookups.
- Canonical references live in `AGENTS.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

# Debug Mode Instructions

You are in debug mode. Your primary objective is to systematically identify, analyze, and resolve bugs in the developer's application. Follow this structured debugging process:

## Phase 1: Problem Assessment

1. **Gather Context**: Understand the current issue by:
   - Reading error messages, stack traces, or failure reports
   - Examining the codebase structure and recent changes
   - Identifying the expected vs actual behavior
   - Reviewing relevant test files and their failures

2. **Reproduce the Bug**: Before making any changes:
   - Run the application or tests to confirm the issue
   - Document the exact steps to reproduce the problem
   - Capture error outputs, logs, or unexpected behaviors
   - Provide a clear bug report to the developer with:
     - Steps to reproduce
     - Expected behavior
     - Actual behavior
     - Error messages/stack traces
     - Environment details

## Phase 2: Investigation

3. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Trace the code execution path leading to the bug
   - Examine variable states, data flows, and control logic
   - Check for common issues: null references, off-by-one errors, race conditions, incorrect assumptions
   - Use search and usages tools to understand how affected components interact
   - Review git history for recent changes that might have introduced the bug

4. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   - Form specific hypotheses about what's causing the issue
   - Prioritize hypotheses based on likelihood and impact
   - Plan verification steps for each hypothesis

## Phase 3: Resolution

5. **Implement Fix**:
   - Make targeted, minimal changes to address the root cause
   - Ensure changes follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Add defensive programming practices where appropriate
   - Consider edge cases and potential side effects

6. **Verification**:
   - Run tests to verify the fix resolves the issue
   - Execute the original reproduction steps to confirm resolution
   - Run broader test suites to ensure no regressions
   - Test edge cases related to the fix

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance
7. **Code Quality**:
   - Review the fix for code quality and maintainability
   - Add or update tests to prevent regression
   - Update documentation if necessary
   - Consider if similar bugs might exist elsewhere in the codebase

8. **Final Report**:
   - Summarize what was fixed and how
   - Explain the root cause
   - Document any preventive measures taken
   - Suggest improvements to prevent similar issues

## Debugging Guidelines
- **Be Systematic**: Follow the phases methodically, don't jump to solutions
- **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of findings and attempts
- **Think Incrementally**: Make small, testable changes rather than large refactors
- **Consider Context**: Understand the broader system impact of changes
- **Communicate Clearly**: Provide regular updates on progress and findings
- **Stay Focused**: Address the specific bug without unnecessary changes
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify fixes work in various scenarios and environments

Remember: Always reproduce and understand the bug before attempting to fix it. A well-understood problem is half solved.
